= Registering {prodname} with a Jira server that uses OAuth

An integration can connect to a Jira server that uses
the OAuth protocol to authenticate access. To enable this, 
register your {prodname} environment as a Jira client application. 
Jira client applications are also referred to as Jira consumers. 
In other words, your {prodname} environment is a Jira consumer. 

[NOTE]
Registration is not required when a Jira server uses only basic authentication.

Follow the procedure here to obtain the Jira OAuth credentials that 
you need to create a {prodname} connection to Jira. For 
more details about registering Jira consumers, including a tutorial
that takes you through the steps with a sample server, see the 
https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication/#overview[Jira documentation about OAuth for REST APIs]

After you register {prodname} with a Jira server, you use {prodname} to create a 
connection to that Jira server. Any number of integrations can use 
the same Jira connection. However, if you want to create another Jira connection, 
you must obtain another set of OAuth credentials by repeating the 
registration procedure provided here. 

.Overview of the main steps
The main steps in the registration procedure are:  

* Obtain the Atlassian command line application that enables you to 
obtain OAuth credentials. 

* Run the downloaded application to create a `config.properties` file. 

* Create a public/private key pair, which {prodname} uses to access a Jira server. 

* Edit the `config.properties` file to update some of its values. 

* Configure your Jira server to recognize your {prodname} environment 
as a consumer application. 

* Obtain a Jira access token that {prodname} needs to access data on your Jira server. 

Each of these steps has several substeps and the procedure below 
provides the details. 

.Prerequisites

* Jira server administration permissions. 
* Familiarity with command line interfaces. 

.Procedure

. Obtain the Atlassian command line application that enables 
you to obtain OAuth credentials: 
.. link:https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/atlassian-oauth-examples/src/master/[Go to the `atlassian-oauth-examples` page].
.. In the left panel, at the bottom, click *Downloads*. 
.. On the *Downloads* page, click *Download repository*. 
.. Extract the file into a directory that you choose.

. Run the downloaded application to create a `config.properties` file 
for OAuth credentials: 
.. In a terminal, navigate to the directory that contains the extracted content.
.. Change to the `java` directory and build the client:
+
----
cd atlassianlabs-atlassian-oauth-examples-dd0264cad043/java
mvn clean compile assembly:single
----
.. Change to the `target` directory and generate the `config.properties` file: 
+
----
cd target
java -jar OAuthTutorialClient-1.0.jar requestToken
----

+
You can ignore the connection exception. In the `target` directory,
there is now a `config.properties` file that contains some 
temporary keys. 

. Generate a public/private key pair that {prodname} needs 
for access to a Jira server. While you can run these commands anywhere, 
the first instruction directs you to a particular directory for convenience: 
.. Navigate to the directory that contains the downloaded application. 
.. Generate a private key: 
+
----
openssl genrsa -out jira_privatekey.pem 1024
----
.. Obtain a public key: 
+
----
openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 -key jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_publickey.cer -days 365
----
+
This command prompts you to enter information about your {prodname} 
environment. Alternatively, to avoid responding to prompts, add the `-subj` 
option to the command. For example, at the end of the command line above, 
add something like this: 
+
----
-subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=New York/O=MyCompany Ltd./OU=IT/CN=mysubdomain.mydomain.com"
----
.. Export the keys: 
+
----
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_privatekey.pcks8
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in jira_publickey.cer  > jira_publickey.pem
----
+
You now have four files: 
+
`jira_privatekey.pcks8` +
`jira_privatekey.pem` +  
`jira_publickey.cer` +
`jira_publickey.pem`

.. Obtain the private key, without the header, line breaks, and footer: 
+
----
cat jira_privatekey.pcks8 | grep -v 'PRIVATE'|awk '{print}' ORS=''
----
.. Copy the private key to the clipboard. 

. Edit the `config.properties` file: 
.. Navigate to the `java/target` directory that contains the `config.properties` 
file and open the file for editing. 
.. In the `config.properties` file, replace the private key with the 
private key that you copied to the clipboard. 
.. Change the `jira_home` setting to the URL for your Jira server. Be sure 
to specify `https` if your Jira server uses `https`. Also, you need to 
escape the colon. For example: 
+
----
jira_home=https\://issues.mycompany.org
----

.. Change the `consumer_key` setting to `*{prodname} App*`. For example: 
+
ifeval::["{location}" == "upstream"]
----
consumer_key=Syndesis App
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{location}" == "downstream"]
----
consumer_key=Fuse Online App
----
endif::[]

.. Save and close the `config.properties` file. 

. Configure your Jira server to recognize your {prodname} environment 
as a consumer application. 
You must be logged in to the Jira server as an administrative user. 
.. Select *Settings* (image:../../images/tutorials/EditorSettings.png[cog]) > *Products* > *Application links*. 
.. In the *Create new link* input field, enter any URL, for example, 
enter: `https://example.com`.
+
This displays a dialog that indicates that no response was received, 
which is okay because only one-way communication is required. 

.. Click *Continue* to display the *Link applications* dialog. 
In this dialog: 
... In the *Consumer Key* field, enter `*{prodname} App*`.
... At the bottom, select *Create incoming link*. 
... In each of the other fields, enter any value. Each field requires a value. 
The value that you enter does not matter because no response is needed.
... Click *Continue* to display another dialog.
... In the *Consumer Key* field, enter `*{prodname} App*`.
... In the *Consumer Name* field, enter `*{prodname} App*`.
... In the *Public Key* field, paste the public key that is in the 
`jira_publickey.pem` file. Be sure to paste only the key without the 
header and footer. To display the key so that you can copy it, in the directory that contains the 
`jira_publickey.pem` file, enter `cat jira_publickey.pem`. 
... Click *Continue*. 

. Obtain a Jira access token that {prodname} needs to access data on 
your Jira server. In the Jira OAuth documentation that is linked to at the 
beginning of this procedure, this step is referred 
to as "The Oauth dance" because there are exchanges among {prodname}, the 
Jira server, and the Jira administrator. 

.. Navigate to the `java/target` directory in the directory that contains 
the command line application that you downloaded in the first step of this
whole procedure. 
.. Obtain a request token from your Jira server: 
+
----
java -jar OAuthTutorialClient-1.0.jar requestToken
----
+
This displays something like: 
+
----
Token:          ec3dj4byySM5ek3XW7gl7f4oc99obAlo
Token Secret:   OhONj0eF7zhXAMKZLbD2Rd3x7Dmxjy0d
Retrieved request token. go to https://jira101.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=ec3dj4byySM5ek3XW7gl7f4oc99obAlo to authorize it
----

.. In another browser tab, go to the URL provided in that output.
That page welcomes you to Jira and prompts you to allow access to
the {prodname} App. 
.. Click *Allow*, which displays an *Access Approved* page with a 
verification code. 
.. Copy the verification code to the clipboard and paste it somewhere 
so that you can easily retrieve it. 

.. Obtain an access token by invoking a command such as the following. 
In the following command line example, the last value is a 
verification code. In the command that you run, replace the 
example verification code with the verification code that you 
copied in the previous step. For example: 
+
----
java -jar OAuthTutorialClient-1.0.jar accessToken qTJkPi
----
+
The output from this command is the access token that {prodname} needs
to access your Jira server. 

.Result
The Jira command line application updates the `config.properties` file
so that it contains all values that you need to configure a 
Jira connection for {prodname}. 

.Next step
Create a Jira connection.
