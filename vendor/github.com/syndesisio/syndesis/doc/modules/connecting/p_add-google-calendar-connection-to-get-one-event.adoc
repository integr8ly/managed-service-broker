= Obtaining a particular event from a Google Calendar

In an integration, you can obtain a particular Google Calendar event
in the middle of a flow. Obtaining a particular event is 
useful, for example, when you want to:

* Update the event in a subsequent Google Calendar connection.
* Announce the event by using a subsequent Twitter connection. 

To obtain one event, add a Google Calendar connection to the middle of 
a flow.

[NOTE]
====
In this release, while obtaining a specific event in a simple integration's 
finish connection is supported, it is not particularly useful. This is 
expected to change in a future release.

.Prerequisites
* You created a Google Calendar connection that is 
authorized to access the Google Calendar that has the event that
that you want to get.

* You are creating or editing a flow and {prodname} is prompting you 
to add to the integration. 

.Procedure
. On the *Add to Integration* page, click the plus sign where you 
want to add the connection. 
. Click a Google Calendar connection that is authorized to access
the calendar that you want to connect to.   
. On the *Choose an action* page, select *Get a Specific Event*. 
. Specify the name of the calendar that has the event that you want.
. Specify the ID of the event to get. To obtain the event ID, do one of the 
following:
+
* Map it from a previous Google Calendar connection. 
* Manually obtain it from the calendar as follows: 
+
.. In a browser, display the calendar that contains the event you want to get. 
.. Append `?gsessionid=OK&eventdeb=1` to the URL and redisplay the calendar.
.. In the calendar, click the event that you want to get. 
.. In the event popup, click 
image:../../images/tutorials/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Options] and select 
*Troubleshooting info*. 
.. In the popup that Google Calendar displays, copy the string that
follows *`eid=`*. For example, an event ID looks something like this: 
`p1pva2a4t504gbsha12di9ch6k_20181107T150000Z*`.

. Click *Next* to add the connection to the flow. 

.Result
The connection appears in the flow 
where you added it. 

.Next step
If you want to map any values from a previous step to the 
fields in this connection, add a data mapper step. First, add 
all needed connections to the flow. Then add a data mapper 
step immediately before this connection.
