= Adding a Twitter connection to trigger integration execution

In a simple integration, the start connection can be a Twitter 
connection that triggers execution of the integration when 
it finds certain tweets or direct messages.

.Prerequisites
* You created a Twitter connection.
* You are creating or editing a simple integration and {prodname} is
prompting you to choose the start connection.

.Procedure

. Click the Twitter
connection that starts the integration. When the integration
uses the selected connection to connect to Twitter, {prodname} uses the
credentials defined in that connection.

. Select the action that you want the connection to perform.
A Twitter connection that you add to an integration performs only
the action that you choose:
+
*  *Mention* monitors Twitter for tweets that contain the Twitter 
handle for the Twitter account that the connection is authorized to access.
Upon finding such a tweet, the connection returns it to {prodname}, which triggers
execution of the integration. 
* *Retrieve* periodically polls Twitter for direct messages sent 
to the Twitter account that the Twitter connection is authorized 
to access. Upon finding such messages, the connection returns them to {prodname}, 
which triggers execution of the integration.
* *Search*  periodically polls Twitter for tweets that match criteria 
that you specify. Upon finding such tweets, the connection returns them 
to {prodname}, which triggers execution of the integration. 

. Configure the action that you selected: 
+
* *Mention* does not require any configuration. 
* *Retrieve* 
** *Count* has a default of 100 and you should not need to change 
this value, which affects internal behavior. However, do not set 
this value to less than 50 because doing so might decrease performance. 
+
The *Retrieve* action always returns all previously unreturned 
direct messages received in the last 30 days. If you do not select 
*Ignore direct messages previously found*, then the *Retrieve* action 
returns all messages that have been received in the last 30 days.

** *Delay* is the period of time between polls. Twitter enforces
rate limits, so you should not poll too often. The default 
interval is 5 seconds. 
** *Ignore direct messages previously found* returns only new 
messages when selected. 

* *Search*
** *Delay* is the period of time between polls. Twitter enforces
rate limits, so you should not poll too often. The default 
interval is 5 seconds. 
** *Ignore tweets previously found* returns only new 
tweets when selected. 
** *Query* is a Twitter-formatted search expression that specifies 
the tweets that you want the connection to return. The following
table provides examples of what you can enter. More details are in this 
link:https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/rules-and-filtering/overview/standard-operators.html[Twitter document for search operators].

|*Query*
|*Results*

|`My Product` 
|Obtains tweets that contain both `My` and `Product`, 
but not necessarily `My Product`.

|`"My Product‚Äù` 
|Obtains tweets that contain an instance of `My Product`.

|`My OR Product`
|Obtains tweets that contain an instance of `My` or `Product` or 
an instance of each one. 

|`My -Product`
|Obtains tweets that contain an instance of `My` and do not contain 
an instance of `Product`. 

|`#MyProduct`
|Obtains tweets that contain the `MyProduct` hashtag.

. Click *Next* to add the connection to the integration.

.Result
The integration now has a start connection and {prodname} is
prompting you to choose the finish connection.
