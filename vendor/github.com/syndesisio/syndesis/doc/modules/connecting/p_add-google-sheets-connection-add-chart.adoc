= Adding a chart to a sheet 

In the middle of a flow, or to finish a simple integration, 
you can add a basic chart or a pie chart to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
To do this, add a Google Sheets connection to the middle of a flow
or as a simple integration's finish connection. Then add a data mapper 
step just before the connection. In the data mapper step, set 
options that determine the location, properties, and content of the chart. 

When {prodname} prompts you to configure the *Add charts* 
action, you can leave some or all fields blank. If you leave a field blank,
you can map a value to that field in the data mapper step that you 
will add just before this connection. 

.Prerequisites
* You created a Google Sheets connection that is authorized to access
the Google spreadsheet that you want to add a chart to.
* You have access to the ID for the spreadsheet that you want to add a chart to.
* You are creating or editing a flow and {prodname} is prompting you
to add to the integration. Or, {prodname} is prompting you to choose the finish 
connection for a simple integration. 

.Procedure
. On the *Add to Integration* page, click the plus sign where you 
want to add the connection. Skip this step if {prodname} is
prompting you to choose the finish connection. 
. Click a Google Sheets connection that is authorized to access
the spreadsheet that you want to add a chart to.
. On the *Choose an action* page, select *Add charts*.
. To configure the *Add charts* action: 
+
.. In the *SpreadsheetId* field, do one of the following: 
+
* Enter the ID of the spreadsheet that you want to add a chart to. 
* Leave the field blank. In the data mapper step that will be just
before this connection, map the spreadsheet ID from 
a previous connection to this connection. The previous connection must 
access the spreadsheet that you want to add a chart to in this connection.

.. In the *Chart Title* field, enter a title. 
+
Alternatively, leave the field blank. In the data mapper step that is 
just before this connection, map the chart title from a source field or 
property to the `title` target field. 

.. In the *Subtitle* field, enter a subtitle. 
+
Alternatively, leave the field blank. In the data mapper step that is 
just before this connection, map the chart subtitle from a source field or 
property to the `subtitle` target field. 

. Click *Next* to add the connection to the flow.
The connection appears in the integration visualization where you added it.
. If you want to add any other connections to the flow, add them now. 
Then return to these instructions. 
. In the integration visualization, click the plus sign that is
just before the connection that adds a chart.
. Click *Data Mapper*.
+
In the data mapper, map source properties, source fields, or source constants to the target 
Google Sheets connection, which is adding a chart. The following instructions
assume that there is a source field, a source property, or a source constant that contains the 
value that you want to map to each target field. 
+
If there is no source for
the required value, then create a source property
in the data mapper by clicking the + sign that is to the right of the 
*Properties* folder. In the *Create Property* dialog, give the property
a name that makes it easy to map to the correct target field, for example, 
specify *`overlayPosition`* as the property name. For the property value,
specify the value that 
you want the connection to use to create the chart. The chartâ€™s overlay 
position field requires A1 notation that identifies a cell. That is, 
it specifies a start position but an end position specification is not 
required, and it is ignored if it is present. For example, 
specify something like `D4` as the value of the *overlayPosition* 
source property. Save the new property.
+
When you configured the *Add charts* action, you might have specified
a value for the spreadsheet ID, the chart title, and/or the chart subtitle. 
If you did, then do not map a value to that field. 

. To add a chart to a sheet, map source properties, source fields
or source constants to target fields as follows: 
+
.. Set the location of the chart by mapping an A1 notation value, 
which identifies a cell, to the *overlayPosition* target field. 
An end position is not required and it is ignored if present. 
The mapped value identifies the cell where Google Sheets places 
the chart. This cell is the upper left corner of the chart display. 
+
If you do not map a value to the *overlayPosition* field, 
and you also do not map a value to the *sheetId* field, which identifies 
the sheet that you want to add the chart to, then the default behavior 
is that Google Sheets creates a new sheet and places the chart in A1.
+
You must map a value to the *overlayPosition* field if you plan to map 
a value to the *sheetId* field.
 
.. Map a source *spreadsheetId* field to the target *spreadsheetId* field. 
The connection uses source data in this spreadsheet to add the chart
to a sheet in this same spreadsheet. The source data and the chart
can be in two different sheets in the same spreadsheet but they
cannot be in two different spreadsheets.  
.. Set a chart title by mapping to the target *title* field. The connection inserts
this string as the title of the chart.
.. Set a chart subtitle by mapping to the target *subtitle* field. The connection inserts
this string as a chart subtitle.

.. Identify the sheet to add the chart to by mapping an integer to the *sheetId* field. 
+
If you map a value to the *sheetId* field then you must also map a value to the *overlayPosition* field. 
+
If you do not map a value to the *sheetId* field and you also do not map a value to 
the *overlayPosition* field, then the connection creates a new sheet and adds 
the chart to the new sheet. 
+
If you do not map a value to the *sheetId* field but you do map 
a value to the *overlayPosition* field, then the connection places 
the chart on the sheet identified by the *sourceSheetId* field. 
This is the sheet that provides the data for the chart. 
+ 
`0` identifies the first sheet in the spreadsheet. 
For subsequent sheets, the sheet ID is at the end of the URL when the 
sheet is visible in a browser. For example, at the end of the following
URL, you can see `gid=206589330`: 
+
`\https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pa...ngQbKkM/edit#gid=206589330`
+
This indicates that the sheet ID is `206589330` and that is the value 
that you would map to *sheetId*. 

.. Identify the sheet that provides the data for the chart by mapping 
its integer sheet ID to the target *sourceSheetId* field. 
The default is `0`, which identifies the first sheet in the spreadsheet.
+ 
You can add a basic chart or a pie chart. Follow one of the following
sets of instructions according to the kind of chart that you want to add.

.. To add basic chart, in the target panel, expand the *basicChart* folder
and map source fields to target fields that are in the *basicChart* folder:

... Set the chart type (`BAR`, `LINE`, `AREA`, or `COLUMN`) by mapping 
to the target *type* field. The default is `COLUMN`.
... Set the title for the bottom axis of the chart by mapping to the 
target *axisTitleBottom* field.
... Set the title for the left axis of the chart by mapping to the 
target *axisTitleLeft* field.
... Set the high level category of information that the chart shows by
mapping to the target *domainRange* field. 
This field uses the Google Sheets A1 notation. For example, suppose that the first 
column in a source sheet provides a list of 5 products in `A2` through `A6` , 
and you want the chart to provide some data for each product. In this column, 
the first cell (`A1`) must contain a label, such as  `Products`. 
The setting of *domainRange* would be `A1:A6`. The chart will contain 
the data that is in `A2` through `A6`. The chart does not display the label.
 
... Identify the location of the source data that the chart shows by mapping to the 
target *dataRange* field. This field uses the Google Sheets A1 notation. 
A chart can provide only one series of data. Continuing with the *domainRange* 
example, suppose that the second column in a source sheet shows the number 
sold for each of the 5 products that are listed in the first column and 
this is the data that you want the chart to show. In this column, 
the first cell (`B1`) must contain a label, such as  `Number Sold`. 
The setting of *dataRange* would be `B1:B6`. The chart will contain 
the data that is in `B2` through `B6`. The chart does not display the label.   

.. To add a pie chart, in the target panel, expand the *pieChart* folder
and map source fields to target fields that are in the *pieChart* folder:
... Set the location of the pie chart legend by mapping to the target  
*legendPosition* field. The default is `LEFT_LEGEND`.
The value must be `BOTTOM_LEGEND`, `LEFT_LEGEND`, 
`RIGHT_LEGEND`, `TOP_LEGEND`, or `NO_LEGEND`.
... Set the high level category of information that the pie chart shows 
by mapping to the target *domainRange* field. 
This field uses the Google Sheets A1 notation. For example, suppose that the first 
column in a source sheet provides a list of 5 products in `A2` through `A6` , 
and you want the chart to provide some data for each product. In this column, 
the first cell (`A1`) must contain a label, such as  `Products`. 
The setting of *domainRange* would be `A1:A6`. The chart will contain 
the data that is in `A2` through `A6`. The chart does not display the label.
... Identify the location of the source data that the chart shows by 
mapping to the target  *dataRange* field. This field uses the Google Sheets 
A1 notation. A chart can provide only one series of data. Continuing with the *domainRange* 
example, suppose that the second column in a source sheet shows the number
