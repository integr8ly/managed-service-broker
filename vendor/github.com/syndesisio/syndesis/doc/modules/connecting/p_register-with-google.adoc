= Registering {prodname} as a Google client application

In an integration, to be able to connect to Gmail, Google Calendar, or
Google Sheets, 
you must register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application.
During registration, you enable Google APIs and create credentials that
{prodname} uses to access the Google APIs that you have enabled.

With registration in place, you can create multiple connections
to Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. You can use each connection 
in multiple integrations. 
While each connection to a Google application can use the
same Google client ID and Google client secret, which you obtain during registration, 
each connection can access
a different Google account, which you choose. 

This procedure instructs you to enable the Gmail API, the Google Calendar API, 
and the Google Sheets API. However, you can enable only the API(s) that you 
need rather than all three APIs. At a later time, if you need to create connections
to the applications whose APIs you did not enable, you can return here and 
follow the instructions to enable their APIs. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create a new Google client application for {prodname}. 
The credentials that Google provides for a new client application contain a 
refresh token that is used for refreshing expired access tokens. This refresh 
token is available only the first time that the {prodname} client application 
uses the credentials. In {prodname}, connections to Gmail, Google Calendar, 
and Google Sheets can all use the same Google client ID and Google client 
secret. If they do, the refresh token is available to all connections 
to Google applications. When you view connection details in the {prodname} 
user interface, do not click the *Validate* button. Validation is a second 
use of the credentials and the refresh token is no longer part of the 
client credentials. You can, however, re-connect to Google applications.

In development environments, be careful if you choose to use the Google client ID and Google client 
secret that you are using for some other, non-{prodname}, OAuth client. 
{prodname} requires offline access that is requested on the first OAuth 
exchange. If another OAuth client already entered the OAuth exchange 
and did not request offline access, then {prodname} cannot obtain 
offline access on subsequent OAuth exchanges. If you are unsure 
whether offline access was requested on the first exchange, 
create a new Google client application for {prodname}.

.Prerequisites
* You must be able to sign in to the Google account that you want to
use to register {prodname} as a Google client application.

.Procedure

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left navigation panel, click *Settings*.
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL,
click
image:../../images/tutorials/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to
copy the callback URL for your {prodname} environment to the clipboard.
You will need this URL later in this procedure.
. In another browser tab, go to `https://console.developers.google.com`
and do the following:
.. Check that you are signed into the Google account that you want to
use to register {prodname} as a Google client application.
Or, choose a different Google account and sign in to that account.
+
The name of the current Google project appears at the top of the Google APIs page.

.. To use the current project to grant authorization to {prodname}, 
continue to the next step. To grant authorization to {prodname} in another 
Google project, choose or create that project. 
If this Google account does not already
have a project, you must create one. 
.. Enable Google APIs:
... In the upper left corner, click 
image:../../images/connecting/Hamburger.png[Navigation menu icon] and select
*APIs and Services* > *Library*.
... If necessary, scroll down to see the *G Suite* row of cards. 
... Click the *Google Calendar API* card, which displays a page that indicates
that the Google Calendar API is enabled.  
... Scroll down and click the *Gmail API* card, which displays a page that indicates
that the Gmail API is enabled.
... In the upper left corner, click 
image:../../images/connecting/Hamburger.png[Navigation menu icon] and select
*APIs and Services* > *Library*.
... If necessary, scroll down to see the *G Suite* row of cards. 
... Click the *Google Sheets API* card, which displays a page that indicates
that the Google Sheets API is enabled.  
.. Give your client application a name:
... Click *MANAGE*. 
... In the page that appears, in the left navigation panel, click
*Credentials* and then on the right, click *Credentials in APIs & Services*.
... Click the *OAuth consent screen* tab.
... In the page that appears, in the *Application Name* field, enter a name for the {prodname}
client application. For example, enter `*{prodname} client application*`.
... Skip the other fields.
... Click *Save*.
.. Obtain client application credentials as follows:
... To the right of *Create Credentials*, click the down arrow to
display a menu and select *OAuth client ID*.
... In the page that appears, select *Web application* to display more content.
... In the *Name* field, enter a name for the OAuth client ID for
your {prodname} environment. This is different from the name that you
entered for the client application itself. For example, enter
`OAuth client ID for {prodname}`.
... Skip *Authorized JavaScript origins*.
... In the *Authorized redirect URIs* field, paste the callback URL
that you copied from your {prodname} environment at the beginning of
this procedure. 
... Click *Create* to display the client ID and client secret for your
{prodname} environment.
.. To the right of the client ID field, click
image:../../images/connecting/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client ID
to your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and do the following: 
.. Expand the entries for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. 
.. In the *Client ID* field for each Google application, 
paste the Google client ID that you just copied.

. Return to the Google developers site and to the right of the
client secret field, click
image:../../images/connecting/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client secret to
your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and do the following in
the entry for each Google application: 
.. In the *Client Secret* field, paste the Google client secret that you
just copied.
.. Click *Save*. You should get a *Registration Successful!* notification.
.. Collapse the entry.

.Results
For each Google application API that you enabled, you can create a 
connection to that application.

All connections from {prodname} to Google applications use the same Google 
client ID and Google client secret. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Google client ID and Google client secret contain token refresh
information to ensure that integrations
that have connections to Google applications continuously work correctly.
Consequently, you should *not* obtain new credentials. If you do, then you
would need to recreate each Google connection, replace the old
connections with new connections, and re-publish each
integration that uses a Google connection.
