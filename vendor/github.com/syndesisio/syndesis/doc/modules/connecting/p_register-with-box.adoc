= Registering {prodname} as a Box client

You must register your {prodname} environment as a client application
that can access Box.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Box. In other words, you need to register a particular
{prodname} environment with Box only once.

In each {prodname} environment, there can be only one registration
of {prodname} as a Box client application. However, while each Box 
connection uses the same registration, it can use different user
credentials. 

.Prerequisites

* You have a Box developer account, which you can obtain at 
link:https://app.box.com/developers/console[].

.Procedure

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, 
click 
image:images/tutorials/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to 
copy the callback URL for your {prodname} environment to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL toward the end of this procedure. 
. In another browser tab, go to the Box developer portal at 
link:https://app.box.com/developers/console[]
and do the following:
.. Sign in.
.. Click *Create New App*.
.. Click *Custom App* and then *Next*. 
.. For *Authentication Method*, click *Standard OAuth 2.0 (User Authentication)* 
and then *Next*. 
.. Enter an app name, for example, *{prodname} Client* and click *Create App*. 
.. Click *View Your App*. 
.. Optional. In the *OAuth 2.0 Credentials* section, copy the client
ID and the client secret to a safe location. These values are 
needed to create a connection to Box. 
.. Click *Save Changes*. 
 
.Result 

Your {prodname} environment is now registered as a Box client, which 
means that {prodname} can access content in the Box account that
you signed into.
