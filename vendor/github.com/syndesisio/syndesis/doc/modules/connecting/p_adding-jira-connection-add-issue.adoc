= Adding an issue to a Jira server

In the middle of a flow, or to finish a simple integration, 
you can connect to a Jira server to add an issue. 

.Prerequisites
* You created a Jira connection.
* You are creating or editing a flow and {prodname} is prompting you
to add to the integration. Or, {prodname} is prompting you to choose
a simple integration's finish connection. 

.Procedure

. On the *Add to Integration* page, click the plus sign where you 
want to add a Jira connection. Skip this step if you are adding 
a simple integration's finish connection.  
. Click the Jira connection that you want the integration to use
to connect to a Jira server. 
. On the *Choose an action* page, select *Add Issue*.
. Configure the action. The required fields are *Issue type ID or name* 
and *Project key*. For the optional fields, you can enter values now, or, 
after you add this connection 
to an integration, you can add a data mapper step before this connection.
In the data mapper step, map fields from previous steps to the optional 
fields in this connection. 
.. Optionally, in the *Assignee* field, enter the Jira user name 
for the person that you want to assign this issue to. 
.. Optionally, in the *Components* field, enter the name of one or 
more components. Separate multiple names with commas. A Jira 
administrator defines the components that you can specify. 
.. Optionally, in the *Priority ID or name*  field, enter a priority
for the new issue. A Jira administrator defines the priority values
that you can enter. 
.. Optionally, in the *Summary* field, enter a brief statement about the issue. 
.. In the *Issue type ID or name* field, enter a value that describes 
the type of the issue. For example, this is often something like `Story`, `Epic`, 
`Chore`, or `Bug`.
+
In Jira, a user with administrator permissions can see a list of valid 
issue types by selecting *Project settings* > *Issue types*. 
A user without these permissions can click in an issueâ€™s type field 
and a list of allowable values should display. 

.. Optionally, in the *Watchers* field, enter a comma-separated list of 
Jira user names. These people receive notifications when this issue is updated. 
.. In the *Project Key* field, enter the short name of a Jira project that a Jira 
administrator has defined. The connection creates the new issue in this
project. For example, a project key is something like `GATE`.
.. Optionally, in the *Description* field, enter any information about this
issue that it is helpful to capture. 

. Click *Next*. 

.Result
The connection appears in the integration visualization
where you added it.
