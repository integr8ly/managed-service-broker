= Finding the data field that you want to map

In a flow with relatively few steps, mapping data fields is easy
and intuitive. In more complex flows or in flows that handle
large sets of data fields, mapping from source to target is easier when
you have some background about how to use the data mapper. 

The data mapper displays two columns of data fields:

* *Sources* is a list of the data fields that are obtained or
processed in all previous steps in the flow. 
* *Target* is a list of the data fields that the next 
connection in the flow expects and can process.

To quickly find the data field that you
want to map, you can do any of the following:

* Search for it. 
+
The *Sources* panel and the *Target* panel each have
a search field at the top. If the search field is not visible, click
image:../../images/tutorials/magnifying-glass.png[Magnifying Glass] at the top
right of the *Sources* or *Target* panel.

* Enter the names of the fields that you want to map. 
+
To do this, 
in the upper right of the *Configure Mapper* page, click the plus sign
to display the *Mapping Details* panel. In the *Sources* section, enter
the name of the source field. In the *Target* section, enter the name of the
field that you want to map to. 

* Expand and collapse folders to limit the visible fields.
+
To view the data fields available in a particular step, expand the 
folder for that step. 
+
As you add steps to a flow, {prodname} numbers and renumbers them to
indicate the order in which {prodname} processes the steps.
When you are adding a data
mapper step, the step numbers appear in the folder labels in the
*Sources* panel and in the *Target* panel.
+
The folder label also displays the name of the data type that is output
by that step. Connections to applications such as Twitter, Salesforce,
and SQL define their own data types. For connecting to applications
such as Amazon S3, AMQ,
AMQP, Dropbox, and FTP/SFTP, you define the connection's input and/or output
type when you add the connection to a flow and select the action
that the connection performs.  
When you specify the data type, you also give the type a name. 
The type name you specify appears as the name of 
a folder in the data mapper. If you specified a description when you 
declared the data type, then the type description appears when you hover
over the step folder in the mapper.
