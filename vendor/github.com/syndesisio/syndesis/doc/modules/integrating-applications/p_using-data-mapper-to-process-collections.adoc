= Using the data mapper to process collections

In a flow, when a step outputs a collection and when a
subsequent connection that is in the flow expects a collection as the input, you can 
use the data mapper to specify how you want the flow to 
process the collection.  

When a step outputs a collection, the flow visualization 
displays *Collection* in the details about the step. For example:

Add a data mapper step after the step that provides the collection and 
before the step that needs the mappings. Exactly where in the flow this 
data mapper step needs to be depends on the other steps in the flow. 
The following image shows mappings from source collection fields 
to target collection fields:

In the source and target panels, the data mapper displays 
image:../../images/integrating-applications/collection-icon.png[this icon] to indicate
a collection. When a source collection or a target 
collection contain only primitive types, the data mapper does not 
display collection fields because there is no need to. You can map 
from/to the collection itself. 

When a collection contains more 
than one kind of primitive type or when it contains at least one complex 
type then the data mapper displays the collectionâ€™s child fields. 
You can map from/to each field.
However, you cannot map from or to a nested collection. 

When {prodname} executes the flow, it iterates over the source 
collection elements to populate the target collection elements.
If you map one or more source collection fields to a target 
collection or to target collection 
fields, the target collection elements contain values for only 
the mapped fields. 

If you map a source collection or a field in a source collection 
to a target field that is not in a collection, then when {prodname} 
executes the flow, it assigns the value from only the last element 
in the source collection. Any other elements in the collection are 
ignored in that mapping step. However, any subsequent mapping steps 
can access all elements in the source collection. 

When a connection returns a collection that is defined in a 
JSON or Java document, the data mapper can usually process 
the source document as a collection.
