= Benefits of using {prodname}

{prodname} has a number of benefits: 

* Integrate data from different applications or services without writing code.

* Run the integration on OpenShift Online in the public cloud or on
OpenShift Container Platform on site.

* Use the visual data mapper to map data fields in one application to data
fields in another application.

* Leverage all the benefits of open source software. You can extend features,
and customize interfaces. If {prodname} does not provide a connector for an
application or service that you want to integrate then a developer can
create the connector that you need.
