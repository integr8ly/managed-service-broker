= Mapping one source field to one target field

The default mapping behavior maps one source field to one target field.
For example, map the `Name` field to the `CustomerName` field.

.Procedure

. In the *Sources* panel, click the data field that you want to map from.
+
You might need to expand a step to see the data fields that it
provides.
+
When there are many source fields, you can search for the
field of interest by clicking the
image:../../images/tutorials/magnifying-glass.png[Magnifying Glass] and entering
the name of the data field in the search field.
. In the *Target* panel, click the data field that you want to map to.
+
The data mapper displays a line that connects the two fields that you just
selected.

. Optionally, preview the data mapping result. This is useful when 
you add a transformation to the mapping or when the mapping requires
a type conversion. 
.. In the upper right of the data mapper, click 
image:../../images/tutorials/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings] and select 
*Show Mapping Preview* to display a text input field on the source
field and a read-only result field on the target field. 
.. In the source field's data input field, enter text. 
.. Click somewhere outside this text box to display
the mapping result in the read-only field on the target field.
.. Optionally, to see the result of a transformation, add a transformation
in the *Mapping Details* panel. 

.. Hide the preview fields by clicking 
image:../../images/tutorials/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings] again and selecting
*Show Mapping Preview*. 

. Optionally, to confirm that the mapping is defined, in the upper right, click
image:../../images/tutorials/grid.png[Grid] to display the defined mappings.

+
You can also preview data mapping results in this view. 
If preview fields are not visible, 
click image:../../images/tutorials/EditorSettings.png[Editor settings] and select 
*Show Mapping Preview*. Enter data as described in the previous step.
In the table of defined mappings, preview fields 
appear for only the selected mapping. To see preview fields for another 
mapping, select it. 
+
Click image:../../images/tutorials/grid.png[Grid] again to display the data field
panels.
. In the upper right, click *Done* to add the data mapper step to the integration. 

.Alternative procedure
Here is another way to map a single source field to a single target
field:

. In the *Configure Mapper* page, in the upper right, click the plus sign
to display the *Mapping Details* panel. 
. In the *Sources* section, enter
the name of the source field. 
. In the *Action* section, accept the
default *Map* action. 
. In the *Target* section, enter the name of the
field that you want to map to and click *Enter*.
