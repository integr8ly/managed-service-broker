= Adding an advanced filter step

In a filter step, {prodname} inspects the
data and continues executing the flow only if the content meets
criteria that you define.
If the basic filter step does not let you
define the exact filter that you need, then add an advanced filter step.

.Prerequisites
* The flow contains all connections that it needs to. 
* You are creating or editing a flow. 
* You are familiar with the Camel Simple Language, or
you have been provided with a filter expression. 

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization, where you want to add an advanced filter step to
the flow, click the
image:../../images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].

. Click *Advanced Filter*.

. In the edit box, use the
link:http://camel.apache.org/simple.html[Camel Simple Language] 
to specify a filter
expression. For example, the following expression evaluates to true
when the message header's `type` field is set to `widget`:
+
----
${in.header.type} == 'widget' 
----
+
In the following example, the expression evaluates to true when the
body of the message contains a `title` field:
+
----
${in.body.title} 
----

. Click *Next* to add the advanced filter step to the flow. 

.Additional property specification in some kinds of flows

In an expression, an additional property specification is required when 
the advanced filter step is in one of the following kinds of flows: 

* An API provider integration operation flow
* A simple integration that starts with a webhook connection
* A simple integration that starts with a custom REST API connection

In these flows, {prodname} wraps the actual message content inside a `body` 
property. This means that the input to the advanced filter contains a 
`body` property that contains another `body` property that contains 
the actual message content. Consequently, in an advanced filter expression
that is in one of these kinds of flows, 
you must specify two instances of `body`. For example, suppose you want 
to evaluate content that is in the `completed` field of the input message. 
Specify the expression like this: 

----
${body.body.completed} = 1
----
