= Adding a data mapper step

Almost all integrations require data mapping. A data mapper step 
maps data fields from the previous
connection(s) and any other steps to data fields that the 
next connection in the flow 
can operate on. For example,
suppose the integration data contains a `Name` field and the next
connection in the flow has a `CustomerName` field. You need to
map the source `Name` field to the target `CustomerName` field.

.Prerequisite

You are creating or editing a flow. 

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization, where you want to add a data mapper step,
click the image:../../images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].
. Click *Data Mapper* to display source
and target fields in the data mapper canvas. 

.Next step

See  link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#mapping-data_map[Mapping data fields to the next connection in the flow].
