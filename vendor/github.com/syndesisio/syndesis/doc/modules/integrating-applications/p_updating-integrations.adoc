= Updating integrations

After you create an integration, you might need to update it to
add, edit or remove a step.

.Prerequisite
In your {prodname} environment, there is a version of the integration
that you want to update.

.Procedure

. In the list of integrations, click *View* for the integration that
you want to update.
. On the integration's summary page, in the upper right corner, click
*Edit Integration*.
+
If this is a simple integration, {prodname} displays the
integration's flow.  If this is an API provider integration, {prodname}
displays the operations list. To update the flow for a particular
operation, click  *Create flow* or *Edit flow* on the right of that 
operation to display its flow. 

. Update the flow as needed:

* To add a step, in the flow visualization, click the plus
sign that is where you want to add the step.
Then click the card that represents the step that you want to add.
