= Starting integrations

The first time that you start an integration, the process is
referred to as publishing the integration because {prodname} has to build
the integration runtime before it can run the integration. At any time,
you can stop running an integration and then start it again.

.Prerequisite
The integration that you want to start is in the *Stopped* state.

.Procedure

. In the left navigation panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, on the right of the entry for the
integration that you want to start, click  
image:../../images/tutorials/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab].
. Select *Start*. 

.Result
{prodname} displays *Starting* as the status of that integration version, 
and then *Running* when the integration is running again.
