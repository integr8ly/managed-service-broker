= How to view and edit connection information

After you create a connection, {prodname} assigns an internal identifier to
the connection. This identifier does not change. You can
change the connection's name, description, or configuration values and
{prodname} recognizes it as the same connection.

There are two ways to view and edit information about a connection:

* In the left panel, click *Connections* and then click any connection to
view its details.

* In the left panel, click *Integrations* and then view any integration
to see its summary page. In the integration's flow diagram:

** For a simple integration, click a
connection icon to view that connection's details.

** For an API provider integration, click view
image:../../images/integrating-applications/ApiProviderReturnIcon.png[flows icon] to display the integration's 
operation list. Click the operation whose flow contains the connection 
that you want to view details for.

On the *Connection Details* page, for the connection that you want to edit, click
image:../../images/integrating-applications/PencilForEditing.png[Edit] next to a field to edit that field.
Or, for some connections, below the configuration fields, click *Edit* to
change configuration values. If you change any values, be sure to click
*Save*.

If you update a connection that is used in an integration that is running,
you must republish the integration.

For connections to applications that use the OAuth protocol to authorize
access, you cannot change the login credentials that the connection uses.
To connect to the application and use different login credentials, you
must create a new connection.
