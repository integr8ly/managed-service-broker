After you create and publish an integration, you might want to update
what the integration does. You can edit a draft of the published integration
and then replace the running version with the updated version.
To facilitate this, for each integration, {prodname} maintains multiple
versions as well as each version's state. 
An understanding of integration versions and states helps you to 
manage your integrations.

.Description of integration versions

In each {prodname} environment, each integration can have multiple
versions. Support for multiple integration versions has several benefits:

* If you publish a version that does not work correctly, then you
can return to running a correct version of the integration. To do that, you
stop the incorrect version and start a version
that runs the way you want it to. 

* As requirements or tools change, you can incrementally update an
integration. You do not need to create a new integration. 

{prodname} assigns a new version number each time it starts running
a new version of an integration. For example, suppose you publish the
Twitter to Salesforce sample integration. After it has been
running, you update the integration to use a different
account to connect to Twitter. You then publish the updated integration.
{prodname} stops the running version of the integration, and 
publishes the updated version of the integration with an incremented 
version number.

The initial integration that was running
is version 1. The updated integration that is now running is
version 2. If you edit version 2, for example to
use a different account to connect to Salesforce, and you publish that
version then it becomes version 3 of the integration.

There can be exactly one draft version of an integration. 
{prodname} has a definition for the draft version of an integration but it 
has never run this version of the integration. The draft version of an integration
does not have a number. When you edit an integration,
you are updating the draft version of the integration. 

In {prodname}, you can see a list of the versions of an integration in the 
integration's summary page. To view this page, in the left navigation
panel, click *Integrations*. In the entry for the integration that you
are interested in, click *View*. 

.Description of integration states

In {prodname}, in the list of integration versions, each entry 
indicates the state of that version, which is one of the following:

[cols="2*"]
|===
|*State*
|*Description*

|*Running*
|A *Running* version is executing; it is in service. Only one version
of an integration can be running. That is, only one
version at a time can be in the *Running* state.

|*Stopped*
|A *Stopped* version is not running. The draft version of an integration
is in the *Stopped* state. Each integration that was running at one time
and then stopped is in the *Stopped* state. 

If no version of this integration is in the *Running* state, 
then you can start a version that is stopped. 

|*Pending*
|A *pending* version is in transition. {prodname} is in the process
of either starting this version of the integration or stopping  
this version of the integration, but
the integration is not yet running or stopped. 

|*Error*
|An integration version that is in the *Error* state 
encountered an OpenShift error while being started or while running. 
The error suspended start-up or execution.  If this happens, try 
starting an earlier integration version that ran correctly. 
Alternatively, contact technical support for help. 
To do that, in any {prodname} page, in the upper right, click the 
image:../../images/tutorials/InfoIcon.png[title="Help"] icon and select *Support*.
