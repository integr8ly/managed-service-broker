= Monitoring integrations with integr8ly

== Prerequisites

The installation of the integr8ly's application monitoring stack requires a user account with cluster admin role. OpenShift's link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_rbac.html#managing-role-bindings[documentation] explains how to manage role binding.

On Minishift, run the following commands to add the `cluster-admin` role to the `developer` user account:

....
oc login -u system:admin
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin developer
oc login -u developer
....
