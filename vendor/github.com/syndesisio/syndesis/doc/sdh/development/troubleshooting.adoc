## Troubleshooting

When things go wrong, you want to try to identify the area that is causing problems (UI, REST API, etc). If it's the UI, look for errors in the browser console or the terminal to see if it's a dependency issue.

### UI Dependency Issues

```
$ rm -rf node_modules
$ yarn install
```


### VM Trouble

*Not getting latest API changes*

This is a known issue. This is the workaround for using the latest REST image from the Docker stream.

*NOTE*: This deletes your Minishift instance, installs OpenShift templates for the pods, and restarts Minishift.

Disclaimer: It's not 100% clear what `-i` docker for `Syndesis Minishift --install` does exactly, but there is no way to invoke those evals before you get a running VM, which is what `--full-reset` does. So as a rule of thumb, you can have a terminal with those evals and keep it open and do all of the Syndesis building from there.

```
$ syndesis minishift --full-reset --install -p syndesis -i docker
```

*syndesis command not found*
If you get `'syndesis' command not found` then use the full path to the `syndesis` binary instead. This assumes you are in the root of the project directory.

```
$ ./tools/bin/syndesis minishift --full-reset --install -p syndesis -i docker
```

*If OpenShift templates have been updated*
This should not be the first choice, since it changes the IP of the VM, and in general should not be necessary for just building and updating the version.

```
$ syndesis minishift --full-reset --install
```

*VM Trouble*

```
$ syndesis build
```

Other things you can try:
- `rm -rf ~/.minishift`
- Check the OpenShift console and look for logs.
- Is it a xip or nip problem? http://downoruprightnow.com/status/nip.io
