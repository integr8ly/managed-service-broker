## Issue Labels

We use GitHub labels to categorize epics, issues and tasks.
They are the foundation of our process, so please use labels for issues.

CAUTION: Labels are living entities. This document describes the current status and might be slightly outdated. Please send a PR to adopt this section if the label structure changes. Also feel free to discuss the label structure anytime. It's essential that labels describe our process, not that we have to adapt our process for these labels.

Labels are grouped.
Each label consists of two parts:
A *Group* and a *Name* which are separated by a slash (`/`).
For example, the label `module/ui` is used to mark issue which is relevant to the Syndesis UI module.

The following label groups are available.
There must be only at most one label from the "Exclusive" groups.

[cols="3,15,^1",options="header"]
|===
| Group
| Description
| Excl.

| **cat/**
| Misc categories which can be added freely
|

| **prio/**
| Priority of the issue. Only one `prio/` label must be added per issue. `prio/p0` is of highest priority, `prio/p2` the lowest one.
| ✔︎

| **ext/**
| Reference to external projects
|

| **source/**
| Where did the issue originate from (stakeholders)? i.e. `source/qe` indicates that QE raised this issue.
|


| **group/**
| Internal Syndesis modules
|

| **source/**
| Which external group has created the issue
|

| **notif/**
| Notification label which can be added and removed to ping certain subteams
|

| **pr/**
| Labels which are only relevant for pull request and which have also some semantics for the bot managing pull requests
|

| **size/**
| Tee shirt size for issues. Sizing is a subjective assessment and should be done relative to other issues.
| ✔︎

| **status/**
| Status of an issue or PR.
|
|===

Each label group serves a particular purpose, and for each issue and PR, it should be considered whether a label from a group applies.

### Groups

Labels from this group reference our application groups like "rest", "ui" or "connector".
Each sub-team is responsible for one or more group, and every group has an 'owning' team.
That does not mean that members of other teams are not allowed to work on such groups.
Contrary, this is even encouraged.
But its just there so that teams can filter on issues and PRs which are relevant to them.

An issue can carry many group labels.
Especially Epics will carry more than such label as they touch more than one group (otherwise it wouldn't be an epic).

For Java code, a "group" roughly corresponds to a directory directly below `app/`

### Pull Requests

This category of labels is all about pull requests.
All of them have a meaning for the https://github.com/syndesisio/pure-bot[pure-bot] bot which watches a pull request and performs certain action.
These actions also involve monitoring and creating labels.

The following labels are involved:

[cols="3,15",options="header"]
|===
|Notification
|Description

| **pr/approved**
{set:cellbgcolor:#86d969}
| This label will be automatically applied to a PR as soon as the PR has been approved at the end of a review. It is an indicator for https://github.com/syndesisio/pure-bot[pure-bot] to automatically merge the pull request if it passes all required tests. You should not set this label manually for approving a PR but using the GitHub button to do so.
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **pr/needs-backport**
{set:cellbgcolor:#5191BF}
| This pull request needs a corresponding backport to the latest patch branch.
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| [white]**pr/review-requested**
{set:cellbgcolor:#50549d}
| In our process it is not mandatory to have a PR review. However, if the author requests a review via the normal GitHub functionality, this label gets applied automatically. When this label is set on a pull-request, then the mandatory status check `pure-bot/review-requested` will only pass if at least a single pull request has been given, so prevents manual merging (without forcing).
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **status/wip**
{set:cellbgcolor:#ffed17}
| This is a PR request label which should be used for "Work-in-Progress" kind of PRs which has been submitted for early review. If this label is present on a PR, the PR is not merged, even when it is approved. A dedicated mandatory status check `pure-bot/wip` monitors this labels and prevents merging if this label is present.
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **status/1.4.x**
{set:cellbgcolor:#91C1BF}
| This pull request is against the 1.4.x patch branch (analogous labels might appear over time)
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|===


### Notification

Notification labels from the `notif/` group serve a particular purpose.
They are used when one team wants to notify another group that a specific issue might have them relevance to them.

[cols="3,15",options="header"]
|===
|Notification
|Description

| **notif/doc**
{set:cellbgcolor:#98cc38}
| The issue needs some attention from the docs team. This might because a new feature has been introduced or, more important, an existing feature has changed for which a documentation already exists.
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **notif/pm**
{set:cellbgcolor:#0052cc}
| The issue needs input from product management.
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **notif/triage**
{set:cellbgcolor:#97bcfc}
| Every new issue gets this label and is considered during a triage session for properly priorisation and categorisation. Remove this label after the triage has happened.
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **notif/uxd**
{set:cellbgcolor:#f382d0}
| This label should be used for issues which needs some attention from the UX team. This might because a new feature has been introduced or, more important, an existing feature has changed for which a UX design already exists.
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|===

It is important to note that these labels also be removed when the notification has been received.

For example, when a UI feature like an input form changes.
Then the UI team attaches a `notif/uxd` label to the PR which introduces this change.
The UX team, detects with a filter search on this label, that there is a new notification.
It then decides, whether UX design needs to be updated or not.
In any case, they are removing the `notif/uxd` label and add a `module/uxd` label if this PR indeed requires a UX design update.
If no update is required, then the label is removed without replacement.

### Source

Labels starting with `source/` indicate the origin of an issue.
It should be applied to help in triaging and priotizing.

[cols="3,15",options="header"]
|===
|Notification
|Description

| **source/qe**
{set:cellbgcolor:#ffff99}
| This issue has been raised by QE
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|===

### External references

This label group should be used if an external system is referenced, which is not part of the Syndesis mono repo.

[cols="3,15",options="header"]
|===
|External Project
|Description


| **ext/atlasmap**
{set:cellbgcolor:#edb080}
| https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap[atlasmap] data mapper
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **ext/qe**
{set:cellbgcolor:#91ac83}
| https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-qe[syndesis-qe] suite
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| **ext/docs**
{set:cellbgcolor:#f9d647}
| https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-documentation[syndesis-documentation] End user documentation
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|===

For the future, we plan to add more of these external repos into the Syndesis mono repo (like documentation or QE).
If this happens, then labels should be converted to `module/` kind of labels.

### Status

Status labels are unique since they may trigger some automatic actions.

The current status labels are:

[cols="3,15",options="header"]
|===
|Status
|Description

| [white]**status/blocked**
{set:cellbgcolor:#ad0009}
| The current issue is blocked by another issue. Refer to the issue itself to see what is blocking this issued. This label is purely informal.
{set:cellbgcolor!}
