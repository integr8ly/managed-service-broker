## UI

After you've set up your initial Local Development environment, you're ready to contribute to the UI.

### Install Dependencies
From the project root directory:

```
$ cd app/ui
$ yarn install
```

### Start up the App
*Using Minishift resources (recommended):*
```
$ yarn start:minishift
```

The `yarn start:minishift` command works when it can properly detect your local development machine's IP address. A proxy server inside the minishift deployment will use that IP address to connect back to the development server being run by the yarn command.  If detection of the IP is failing for you, then set the `SYNDESIS_DEV_LOCAL_IP` env variable to your local machine's IP address before running the yarn `yarn start:minishift` command.

### Open in Your Browser
Open the Syndesis UI in your browser from the command line by running:

```bash
# on macOS
$ open https://$(oc get routes syndesis --template "{{.spec.host}}")
```

```bash
# on linux
$ xdg-open https://$(oc get routes syndesis --template "{{.spec.host}}")

```

```bash
# on windows
$ start https://$(oc get routes syndesis --template "{{.spec.host}}")
```

Another option is to run `minishift console`, go into *My Project* and click on the URL for the Syndesis app.

To verify that you're running against the development instance of the UI check the title of the browser tab you've opened and ensure it says `DEVELOPMENT` in in somewhere.

*Not using Minishift resources*
In the event that you have issues with Minishift. Don't be surprised if most things don't load and there isn't any data in the UI. Only use this if you're totally blocked and need to work on something minor/aesthetic in the UI.

```
$ yarn start
```

### Running Tests
To run tests or lint there are two more commands you can run in separate terminals.

```
$ yarn test
```

### Running Linter
If you don't, the CI will, and your PR build will likely fail.

```
$ yarn lint
```

You should be able to access the UI in your browser at http://localhost:4200

### Code Documentation

We use https://compodoc.github.io/website/[Compodoc] for documentation, or https://compodoc.github.io/website/guides/comments.html[here] to see how to format comments. Files get generated automatically in the `/documentation` directory. Read the documentation [here](https://compodoc.github.io/website/guides/getting-started.html) to see how to properly document features. You can automatically generate and run docs using Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn compodoc
```

Or manually with `compodoc -s`, or `compodoc` if you want it to simply generate the files in the default `/documentation` directory and run it with an HTTP server.
