= How to process a collection in a flow
:context: collection

Sometimes, a connection returns a collection, which contains 
multiple values that are all the same type. 
When a connection returns a collection, the flow can 
operate on the collection in a number of ways, including:

* Execute each step once for the collection.
* Execute each step once for each element in the collection.
* Execute some steps once for the collection and execute other 
steps once for each element in the collection.

To decide how to operate on a collection in a flow, you need to 
know which applications the flow connects to, whether they can 
handle collections, and what you want the flow to accomplish. 
You can then use the information in the 
following topics to add steps to a flow that processes a collection:

* xref:using-data-mapper-to-process-collections_{context}[]
* xref:add-split-step_{context}[]
* xref:add-aggregate-step_{context}[]
* xref:example-processing-collection_{context}[]
