= Connecting to Salesforce

:context: salesforce

In an integration, to connect to Salesforce, you must register your
{prodname} environment as a Salesforce client application. This authorizes
{prodname} to access Salesforce. With registration in place, you create
a Salesforce connection, which you can then add to any number of 
integrations. For details, see the following topics:
