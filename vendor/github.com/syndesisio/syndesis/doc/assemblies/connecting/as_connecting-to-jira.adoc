= Connecting to Jira
:context: jira

In an integration, you can connect to a Jira server to 
obtain, create, or update issues. Jira is a tool for 
planning, tracking, and managing software development projects. 
Each Jira environment allows customization of the workflow, which 
has an effect on the details for connecting to Jira in an integration. 
Consulting with your Jira administrator should clarify the details. 

The following topics provide information and procedures for creating integrations 
that connect to a Jira server:

* xref:registering-with-jira_{context}[]
* xref:creating-jira-connections_{context}[]
* xref:adding-jira-connection-start_{context}[]
