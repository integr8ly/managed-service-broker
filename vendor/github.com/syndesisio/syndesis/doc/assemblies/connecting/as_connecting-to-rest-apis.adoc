= Connecting to REST APIs
:context: rest

In an integration, to connect to a REST API, you must have created a
connector for that API by uploading an OpenAPI document that
describes the API. See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#adding-api-connectors_custom[{NameOfFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}, Adding and managing REST API client connectors].

When a connector for the REST API you want to connect to
is available in {prodname},
the steps for connecting to that REST API are:

* xref:register-with-rest-api_{context}[] if required
* xref:create-rest-api-connection_{context}[]
* xref:add-api-client-connection_{context}[]
