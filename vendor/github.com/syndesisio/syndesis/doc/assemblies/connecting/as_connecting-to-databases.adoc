= Connecting to SQL databases
:context: db

In an integration, you can connect to any of the following types of SQL
databases:

* Apache Derby
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL

Create a connection to the database that you want to access in an integration.
Then create an integration and add that database connection to the 
integration.

To connect to other types of databases, you must upload a JDBC driver for
that database.
