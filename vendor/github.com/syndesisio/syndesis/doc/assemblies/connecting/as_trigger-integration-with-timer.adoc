= Triggering integration execution with a timer
:context: timer

To trigger execution of a simple integration according to a schedule that
you specify, add a timer connection as a simple integration's start
connection. {prodname} provides a timer connection, which you can use
to start as many simple integrations as you like. You do not need to create
a timer connection unless you inadvertently delete the provided
timer connection. Details are in the following topics:

* xref:add-timer-connection_{context}[]
* xref:create-timer-connection_{context}[]
