:context: mqtt

MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight,
machine-to-machine, internet of things, connectivity protocol. 
In an integration, you can obtain messages from or publish messages to
an MQTT broker. To do this, create a connection to the MQTT broker
of interest and then add that connection to an integration flow.
