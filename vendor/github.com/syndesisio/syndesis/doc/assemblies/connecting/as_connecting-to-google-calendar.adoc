To trigger integration execution when a poll returns an update to a
Google calendar, add a Google Calendar connection to a simple integration 
as its start connection. To add an event to a calendar or update an
event in a calendar, you can do either of the following: 

* Add a Google Calendar connection to the middle of a flow.
* Add a Google Calendar connection to finish a simple integration.
